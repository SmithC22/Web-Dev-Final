				What is Perfect Pronunciation?
			</p>
			<p>
				Perfect Pronunciation is a resource for verbal practice and understanding of the English language. Users can listen to the same word said in a variety of accents and pronunciations, and attempt to parse them out.
				<br><br>

				An important part of practical language learning is listening comprehension. If you move to a new place with lots of different accents and dialects, not everyone is going to talk like the voice in Duolingo, or an in-person teacher.
				<br>
				This project works in an under-served area of language learning, but one that is still incredibly important.
